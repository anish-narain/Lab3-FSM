# Task 3 - Exploring the clktick.sv and the delay.sv modules #
In this task we are understanding the clktick.sv module (flexible timer). To do so I need to:

* Understand the clktick.sv module
* Understand the testbench function
* Run metronome and compare

We are visualising the clktick module's function by looking at how quickly the neopixel strip LEDs turn on and off. Everytime the tick output is generated by clktick the lights turn on for a fixed time, then they turn off. 

The module is designed so that clktick generates a 1 (tick signal) every N+1 cycles. So for N cycles, there is a gap between one tick and another. Since N is set by vbdValue(), by turning the encoder we change number of cycles between one tick and another and therefore change the time between light turning on and then light turning on again.

## Matching with metronome ##

# Test Yourself Challenge #
In this challenge I had to combine the clktick.sv module (flexible timer) with f1_fsm.sv (the F1 lights finite state machine that turns a LED on one-by-one until all 8 are turned on and then they all turn off).

The output of the flexible timer is the enable input of the finite state machine. Everytime the timer generates a tick signal, the finite state machine goes to its next state. Thus we can use the flexible timer to control the delay between each state transition.

To achieve this I had to:
* Create a top-level module which combines the clktick with f1_fsm
* Create a testbench for driving the inputs and displaying

## Top-Level Module ##
## Testbench Function ##
## Final Results ##
It is difficult to show the final product in images, however, setting the rotary encoder to 24 meant the vbdValue() = N = 24. This meant there was a delay of 24 cycles between consecutive ticks which equates to a second in real time. Hence the f1 state machine changes state every second. 

Rotating the encoder changes the vbdValue() thus changing the delay between state transitions.

* Increasing the vbdValue() increased the number of cycles between subsequent ticks from the flexible timer, making the f1 sequence more delayed.
* Decreasing the vbdValue() decreased the number of cycles, making the f1 sequence occur more quickly.
