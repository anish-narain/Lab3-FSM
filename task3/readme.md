# Task 3 - Exploring the clktick.sv and the delay.sv modules #
In this task we are understanding the clktick.sv module. To do so I need to:

* Understand the clktick.sv module
* Understand the testbench function
* Run metronome and compare

We are visualising the clktick module's function by looking at how quickly the neopixel strip LEDs turn on and off. Everytime the tick output is generated by clktick the lights turn on for a fixed time, then they turn off. The module is designed so that clktick generates a 1 (tick signal) every N+1 cycles. So far N cycles there is a gap between one tick and another. Since N is set by vbdValue(), by turning the encoder we change number of cycles between one tick and another and therefore change the time between light turning on and then light turning on again.
